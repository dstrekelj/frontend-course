Popular task runners (in alphabetical order):
- [Gulp](#gulp)
- NPM scripts

### Gulp

The gulp official website can be found [here](https://gulpjs.com/).

Gulp is a task runner and automation tool. With gulp you can specify tasks and process pipelines in JavaScript and run them when necessary to handle asset bundling, optimisation, and more.

Gulp can be installed from NPM. For more information follow the [official installation instructions](https://gulpjs.com/docs/en/getting-started/quick-start).

To get started with gulp, install it as a development dependency of your project:

```
npm install --save-dev gulp
```

Create a `gulpfile.js` file in your project root. This will configure gulp with tasks it can recognise and run.

#### Bundling scripts

To bundle JavaScript source code with gulp we will install Babel and uglify plugins. Babel will help us transpile modern ES6+ syntax to the more commonly supported ES5 syntax. Uglify will optimise our bundle for production through minification and uglification of source code.

```
npm i -D gulp-uglify gulp-babel @babel/core @babel/preset-env
```

> :point_up: **Note!**
>
> We need to install additional Babel packages for the Babel gulp plugin to work. The gulp plugin is a helper utility that manages Babel for us. We still need Babel as a separate dependency for gulp to have something to work with.

After installing the necessary plugins we can create a `js` gulp task to bundle our JavaScript assets.

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const babel = require('gulp-babel');
const uglify = require('gulp-uglify');

gulp.task('js', function () {
    return gulp.src('./main.js')
        .pipe(babel({ presets: [ '@babel/preset-env' ] }))
        .pipe(uglify())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build'));
});
```

Now we can add a script for the task to our `package.json`.

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        "js": "gulp js"
    }
    // ...
}
```

To run our gulp task simply run the new script.

```
npm run js
```

> :point_up: **Note!**
>
> Gulp does not bundle our scripts like webpack does. It only cares about taking the input and applying plugins to it. If you want gulp to bundle your assets as well as run it through its plugins, you need to configure it to use bundling plugin like webpack-stream.

#### Bundling styles

To bundle stylesheets written in Sass with gulp we will install Sass and cssnano plugins. The Sass plugin will ensure our Sass stylesheets are compiled down to CSS, while the cssnano plugin will optimize our stylesheet for production using minification techniques.

```
npm i -D gulp-sass gulp-cssnano
```

After installing the necessary plugins we can create a `sass` gulp task to bundle our stylesheets.

```js
const gulp = require('gulp');
const sass = require('gulp-sass');
const cssnano = require('gulp-cssnano');

gulp.task('sass', function () {
    return gulp.src('./style.scss')
        .pipe(sass())
        .pipe(cssnano())
        .pipe(gulp.dest('build'));
});
```

Now we can add a script for the task to our `package.json`.

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        "sass": "gulp sass"
    }
    // ...
}
```

To run our gulp task simply run the new script.

```
npm run sass
```

#### Watching for changes

Gulp can watch our files for changes and trigger tasks when a change occurs. This way we can listen to changes made to our source files and trigger rebuilds when necessary.

Gulp does not require a plugin to watch source files. All it requires is one or more files or file paths to watch, and tasks to run in series when a change happens to any of the watched files.

We can add a `watch` gulp task without any additional steps.

```js
gulp.task('watch', function () {
    gulp.watch([ 'main.js', 'src/**/*.js' ], gulp.series('js'));
    gulp.watch('style.scss', gulp.series('sass'));
});
```

Now we can add a script for the task to our `package.json`.

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        "watch": "gulp watch"
    }
    // ...
}
```

To run our gulp task simply run the new script.

```
npm run watch
```

#### Creating a default task

Gulp can be conigured with a default task that is run whenever gulp is called without a task argument.

We can create a default task that will first bundle our JS, then our Sass, and finally begin watching our files. This is a common way to setup a development environment with gulp.

```js
gulp.task('default', gulp.series('js', 'sass', 'watch'));
```

Now we can add a script for the task to our `package.json`.

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "gulp"
    }
    // ...
}
```

To run our gulp task simply run the new script.

```
npm run dev
```
