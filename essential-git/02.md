## GitHub

GitHub is a platform that provides remote Git repositories as a service.

> :point_up: **Note!** GitHub isn't the only platform on the market. Popular alternatives are GitLab and Bitbucket.

### Creating a GitHub repository

GitHub users can create public and private repositories.

### Adding a remote repository

```
git remote add origin ...
```

### Pushing changes to the remote repository

```
git push
```

### Pulling changes from the remote repository

```
git pull
```

### Choosing what to track in repositories

Not all files should be tracked by Git, such as files containing sensitive information and files that are a byproduct of the development process. We can tell Git which files to ignore by creating one or more `.gitignore` files in the repository. The `.gitignore` file is a plain text file containing the names or paths to ignored files and folders.

An example `.gitignore` file:

```sh
.DS_Store
node_modules
```

In this example:

- Any file or folder with the exact name `.DS_Store` is ignored
- Any file or folder with the exact name `node_modules` is ignored

> :pencil: **Homework!** `.gitignore` uses glob patterns to match against file names. Research glob patterns. Define glob patterns for ignoring the following:
>
> - `build` folder in the root of the repository
> - all files in the repository that end with the `.log` extension
> - all files in the repository that begin with `.env`, including `.env `, except for `.env.example`

Git can only ignore untracked files. Files that were previously tracked have to first be removed from the repository before being added to `.gitignore`. Git will then continue ignoring them from that point onward until the files are removed from `.gitignore`.

> :pencil: **Homework!** Set up a repository and commit a couple of files so that Git can track them. Try using `.gitignore` to ignore the files that were previously tracked. After committing the `.gitignore` file, try changing the ignored files and committing the change. Answer the following questions:
>
> - Did Git ignore the changes to ignored files?
> - Which steps must we take to make Git untrack and ignore the files in the repository?
> - Are the files still visible in the commit history after being untracked and ignored?

Git cannot track empty folders, but empty folders can be useful to outline a project's architecture ahead of time. The current convention to tracking empty folders is to create a single empty file named `.gitkeep` into the empty folder we want to track. The `.gitkeep` file can be removed later on when the folder is populated with actual project files.

> :point_up: **Note!** The name `.gitkeep` has no special meaning to Git. It's a name chosen by developers to clearly communicate the file's purpose in the project - to keep the otherwise empty folder in the Git repository.
