## Version Control

**Version control** is the practice of keeping track of changes made to data. A **version control system (VCS)** is software that tracks and manages changes made to data on behalf of the user. Word processors such as Microsoft Word, for example, use a type of VCS to track the history of changes made to the document.

In the world of software development, the VCS tracks changes made to the files of a software project in a database called a **repository**. Every change stored in a repository is called a **commit** - as in, a change was committed to the project files.

A VCS can be either centralised or distributed. **Centralised VCS** host the repository on a server that client computers connect to in order to push and pull changes from the repository. **Distributed VCS** opt for every computer to have its own copy of the repository that the computers then synchronise between themselves in a network of peers. The peer-to-peer approach of a distributed VCS means users can work offline, privately, and not worry about losing data since backups are a positive side-effect of everyone having a copy of the repository. However, distributed VCS also require more storage space on the user's computer and may pose a security risk due to code base exposure - again, a side effect of everyone having a copy of the repository.

## Git

Our VCS of choice will be **Git** - a free, open source, and widely available distributed VCS. Although others exist (such as Subversion and Mercurial), Git has become the de facto standard for the software industry. Git works best on plain text files where it can tell which lines in the file have changed between versions. In case of binary file formats such as images and videos, Git opts to completely replace the old version with thew version of the file.

> :point_up: **Note!** From this point on, we will discuss version control as it is handled by Git. Terminology and implementation details may differ between different VCS, but the general idea is roughly the same.

Git differentiates between tracked and untracked files. **Tracked files** are files that were at some point stored in the repository. **Untracked files** are files that were not yet stored in the repository. Git can only version tracked files because the repository then contains reference points for changes between file versions.

Files are tracked by committing them to the repository. A **commit** contains one or more changes made to tracked files, along with a commit message and a bundle of useful information such as the author of the change, the time and date of the change, and a unique hash ID of the change called the **commit hash**.

Every commmit represents a snapshot of a state in which the repository was recorded to be at a set point in time. The commit that represents the currently observed repository state is called the **HEAD** commit.

A **Git repository** stores commits in a tree-like fashion where every commit belongs to a **branch**. To continue the analogy, the **trunk** of the tree is commonly called the **master branch** - the "masterwork" or latest (usually stable) state of the project - and represents the branch from which all other branches are made.

An example commit:

```
commit 3885d0486081028962f580eef0f08ddb6804d2a0 (HEAD -> master)
Author: John Doe <john.doe@example.com>
Date:   Sat Jul 23 13:05:12 2022 +0200

    Initial commit
```

In this example:

- the commit hash is `3885d0486081028962f580eef0f08ddb6804d2a0`
- the current branch is `master`, this is where the `HEAD` is located
- the commit author is `John Doe` and the author's contact email is `john.doe@example.com`
- the commit date and time is `Sat Jul 23 13:05:12 2022 +0200`
- the commit message is `Initial commit`

### Initialising a Git repository

Initialise a Git repository with

```sh
git init
```

```sh
git status
```

### Tracking files with commits

```
git add
```

```
git commit
```

### Reviewing the commit history

The commit history of a repository might look like this:

```
* 214291a (HEAD -> master) Add index and images
* 36e9ad7 Add README file
* 80c7f54 Initial commit
```

## GitHub

### Creating a GitHub repository

### Adding a remote repository

### Pushing changes to the remote repository
