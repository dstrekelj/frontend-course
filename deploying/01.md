We can deploy our web application on a dedicated server or cloud service provider. There are many options to choose from, most of which have free tiers or pricing plans with reasonable restrictions.

Popular platforms (in alphabetical order):
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
- [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

Popular cloud service providers (in alphabetical order):
- [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/)
- [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
- [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud)
- [Microsoft Azure](#microsoft-azure)

## Microsoft Azure

The Microsoft Azure official website can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

It is necessary to provide valid payment information (credit or debit card) to register an account.

After registration the account receives credit that can be spent on select Microsoft Azure services, making it possible to use Azure for free within the credit limit.

To deploy a front-end web application on Microsoft Azure follow these steps:
1. Create a Microsoft Azure account [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/) or use an existing account.
2. Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-windows?view=azure-cli-latest).
3. Open a terminal and sign into Azure CLI.

```
az login
```

4. Create a resource group for your web application. Replace `<group-name>` with your desired group name.

```
az group create --name <group-name> --location "East US"
```

5. Create a payment plan for your web application. We will use the free plan. Replace `<plan-name>` with your desired group name.

```
az appservice plan create --name <plan-name> --resource-group <group-name> --sku FREE
```

6. Create an Azure Web Application for the previously created resource group and payment plan. Replace `<app-name>` with your desired group name.

```
az webapp create --resource-group <group-name> --plan <plan-name> --name <app-name>
```

> :point_up: **Note!**
>
>  If the Azure Web Application was created successfully, a JSON output should be visible in your terminal. Take note of the `defaultHostName` attribute value. The URL assigned to it (e.g. `<my-app-name>.azurewebsites.net`) is the URL of your web application. At this point you can open the link in your browser and begin working on hosting your web application!

7. Set up the Azure Web Application to use a Node.js environment.

```
az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=12
```

> :point_up: **Note!**
>
>  The LTS version of Node may have changed since these notes were last updated. Make sure to set the `WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION` setting to your desired Node version or the Node version the application was developed with.

8. Open your Azure Web Application's Zip Deploy UI page.

```
https://<my-app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/ZipDeployUI
```

> :point_up: **Note!**
>
>  The Zip Deploy UI is a simple user interface for uploading the latest build of your web application to Azure in the form of a Zip archive. It's similar to using FTP or the File Manager utility used by cPanel and Plex web hosting platforms. Read more the Zip Deploy UI [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-web-get-started-nodejs#create-a-project-zip-file).

9. Create a Zip archive of your web application's build folder and upload it through the Zip Deploy UI by dragging and dropping the Zip archive onto the UI.

> :point_up: **Note!**
>
> Make sure the build assets are not stored in a directory. The files to be deployed to Azure must be in the root of the Zip archive, otherwise the files will be hosted from the folder they're stored inside the archive (e.g. `build/index.html` instead of `index.html`).

10.   Once the deployment completes successfully, open the `defaultHostName` URL from step 6 again. If everything went right, you should see your website in the browser. Congratulations!

If you do not need your web application anymore, you can delete all allocated Azure resources by deleting the resource group:

```
az group delete --name <group-name>
```

> :point_up: **Note!**
>
> When using cloud service providers with free plans or free credit systems, make sure to shut down any and all services used when you don't need need them or before the free period expires. Otherwise you may be charged a fee for using the services beyond the free period!

> :pencil: **Homework!**

> Try deploying the solution to one of the exercies from previous modules to one or more platforms or cloud service providers.
